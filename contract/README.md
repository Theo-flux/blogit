# How we built it!

  Our solution is architected using a hybrid-dApp approach, with the foundation being laid on Algorand consensus network. Our interaction layer is composed of React to handle the user environment. The smart contract was written in REACH DAPP language and successfully deployed on Algorand. The storage technology is  IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralised storage system.
